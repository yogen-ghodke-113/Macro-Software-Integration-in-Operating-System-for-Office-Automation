## Abstract
<i>Automation is the creation of tools to automate any task or a group of tasks sequentially without human
intervention. Such automation systems are widely used in the industry in a huge variety of applications, especially
on the production line of machines. Automation is not only limited to performing physical tasks but is also used to
carry out virtual operations. Applications and methods of automation in terms of software are pretty limited. In
current times, employees in corporate sector invest an unnecessarily high amount of time in performing menial
repetitive tasks, thus hampering their work productivity and resulting in a loss to the company. The time saved if
these tasks could be dealt more effectively will help in the growth of overall work execution. After understanding this
issue, the authors decided to work on this issue and this paper is a result of these efforts. The main objective of this
paper is to develop a model which would address the issues present in the current scenario and be viable at the
same time. The main issues while developing such a system was that it could result in heavy usage of computational
resources, but the model proposed solves this issue. The paper combines the principles of sub-domains of Artificial
Intelligence i.e. Cognitive Action Selection, Self-Management, Network Management Systems, Expert Systems to
design the model, thus being competent as a Smart System. This paper focuses on a fundamentally different
approach to software automation in corporate environments in reducing time-complexity, resulting in a paradigm
shift in the conventional approach towards enhancing organizational productivity.</i>
